## **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **a) Discard the Variable “No”**
**Objective:** Remove the "No" column from your dataset.

**Explanation:**
- The "No" variable represents the row number, which is typically redundant as it doesn't provide any meaningful information for analysis.
- Removing unnecessary variables simplifies your dataset and focuses your analysis on relevant features.

**Steps:**
1. **Identify the Column:** Locate the "No" column in your dataset.
2. **Remove the Column:** Exclude this column from your data frame, resulting in a dataset without the "No" variable.

---

### **b) Split the Variable “Min” Using `strsplit()`**
**Objective:** Extract the total minutes played by each player from the "Min" variable.

**Explanation:**
- The "Min" variable likely contains minutes in a string format (e.g., "34:12" representing 34 minutes and 12 seconds).
- Using `strsplit()`, you can separate the minutes and seconds, focusing on the total minutes played.

**Steps:**
1. **Apply `strsplit()`:** Use this function to split the "Min" string at the colon (`:`).
2. **Store Output as “aux”:** Assign the resulting list to a new variable named "aux".
3. **Extract Minutes:** From each split, take the first element, which represents the total minutes played, and store it for further analysis.

---

### **c) Add a Numerical Variable Named “Min 2”**
**Objective:** Create a new variable that represents the average minutes each player played per game.

**Explanation:**
- "Min" provides total minutes played, but averaging this per game gives a better understanding of player participation.
- This helps normalize the data, especially if players have participated in different numbers of games.

**Steps:**
1. **Calculate Average Minutes:** For each player, divide the total minutes played by the number of games played ("GP").
2. **Create “Min 2”:** Add this calculated average as a new numerical column in your dataset.

---

### **d) Check the Structure of the Data and Assign Correct Types**
**Objective:** Ensure each variable in your dataset has the appropriate data type (categorical or numerical).

**Explanation:**
- Proper data typing is crucial for accurate analysis, especially for PCA and MDS which treat variables differently based on their types.
- Categorical variables include factors like "TEAM", "PLAYER", and "POSITION".
- Numerical variables include statistics like "PTS", "AST", "TR", etc.

**Steps:**
1. **Review Data Structure:** Use functions like `str()` to inspect each variable's current type.
2. **Assign Correct Types:**
   - **Categorical Variables:** Convert variables like "TEAM", "PLAYER", and "POSITION" to factors.
   - **Numerical Variables:** Ensure that statistical measures (e.g., "PTS", "AST") are numeric.
3. **Verify Changes:** Recheck the structure to confirm that all variables have been correctly typed.
